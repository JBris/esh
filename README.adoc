*esh* (embedded shell) is a templating engine for evaluating shell commands embedded in arbitrary templates.
It's like ERB (Embedded RuBy) for shell, intended to be used for templating configuration files.

esh is implemented in ~160 lines (LoC) of shell and awk.


== Requirements

* http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html[POSIX-sh] compatible shell (e.g. Busybox ash, dash, ZSH, bash, …)
* common Unix userland with `awk` and `sed` (e.g. from Busybox, GNU, …)


== Usage

Read man page link:{script-name}.1.adoc[{script-name}(1)].

You can add {script-name} as a submodule into your repository or download it on demand, e.g.:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{gh-name}/v{version}/{script-name} \
    && echo '{script-sha1}  {script-name}' | sha1sum -c \
    || exit 1


== Credits

ESH template syntax is based on ERB (Embedded Ruby).

Tests and some concepts are inspired by https://github.com/jwilk/shellcat[shellcat].
